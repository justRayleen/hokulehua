# Hokulehua LLC: Building Cognitive-Somatic Systems

## Overview

This repository hosts the official landing page for **Hokulehua LLC**, a venture dedicated to **building cognitive-somatic systems that turn embodied intelligence into structured, scalable design.**

This minimalist, dark-themed landing page provides an introduction to Hokulehua LLC, its founder Rayleen Egami, and its groundbreaking frameworks: Compass CORE Mapping and Adaptive Care & Contextual Intelligence.

## About Hokulehua LLC & Rayleen Egami

Founded by **Rayleen Egami**, Hokulehua LLC creates unique frameworks that integrate perception, thought, and design. The focus is on transforming internal feelings and body signals into practical tools without the need for external sensors. These systems are built on strong ethical values, inspired by traditional ecological knowledge, and honor the subtle, interconnected ways we experience the world through our bodies and minds.

## Key Frameworks

### Compass CORE Mapping

A cognitive-somatic interface that converts internal signals into structured directional feedback, recognizing the human body as a data-generating system without external sensors. Its goal is to empower individuals to define emotions based on their own lived experiences, promoting emotional literacy and self-understanding.

**Key aspects include:**
* Embodied intelligence → directional output
* Music and sensation as emotional classifiers
* Patentable system architecture
* Mobile-first UX and scaling strategy
* No wearables, no artificial affect recognition — fully internally generated

### Adaptive Care & Contextual Intelligence

This framework helps institutions make decisions rooted in nuanced, real-world understanding by blending real-time signals with cultural values, historical patterns, and biological relevance. The goal is to integrate historical and cultural contexts beyond traditional data, enabling ethical, adaptive, and culturally-aware decisions.

**Key aspects include:**
* Customizable Care Index: Balances signal strength, historical resonance, biological impact, and value alignment
* Generational Context Coefficient: Adjusts prioritization based on evolving social, environmental, and ethical trends
* Cultural calibration: Enables organizations to tailor decision-making to their identity, history, and priorities
